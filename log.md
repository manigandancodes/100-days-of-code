# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: As part of Complete React Developer in 2020 by Andrei Neagoie, Yihua Zhang, I watched few lessons and added some components to the crwn-clothing react app.

**What did I do?😃:** I was blindly coding along with the lesson with getting the concepts, so I deleted everything from the crwn-clothing react app, then I watched the lesson and understood what was happening in the app, I was able to code the crwn-clothing app without seeing the tutor's code. Yes, I struggled a lot but in the end when the code works as expected the feeling is incredible.
